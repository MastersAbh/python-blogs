<p><a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular high-level programming
language. It is a general-purpose language used by scientists, developers,
and many others who want to work more quickly and integrate systems more
effectively.

</p><p><a href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> (GSoC) is
a global program that offers post-secondary students an opportunity to be
paid for contributing to an open source project over a three month period.
Since 2005, the Python Software Foundation has served as an "umbrella
organization" to a variety of Python-related projects, as well as sponsoring
projects related to the development of the Python language.
