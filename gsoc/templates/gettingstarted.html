<div class="header"><h1>Getting Started</h1></div>

<p> Here's 7 things you can do to get started in free and open source
software:

</p><ol type="1">
   <li><strong>Choose an organization to work with.</strong>
   <br>There's hundreds of thousands of projects that use Python, and you
need to narrow
down the list before you can get help or do much that's useful.  See <a href="faq.html#choosing">How do I choose a project or sub-org?</a> for ideas
on how to do that.
   <ul>
		<li>Hint: If you're a beginner, look for a project with lots of mentors
available and projects marked as suitable for beginners.  (Core Python development
is not usually beginner suitable.)</li>

		<li><em>Any</em> open source experience will help you prepare for GSoC,
so don't worry too much about what project you try first and don't be afraid
to change your mind!</li>

		<li>For GSoC applications, you'll need to choose from <a href="http://python-gsoc.org/#ideas">the list of accepted sub-orgs</a> (Or
google's list of big orgs!).  If your favourite group isn't on the list,
contact them to see if they're interested in participating.  Applications not
associated with a known sub-org are usually rejected because we don't have
mentors available.

   </li></ul>

   </li><li><strong>Set up your own development environment.</strong>
	<br>Document what you do so you can remember it later, and so you can
help others if they get stuck! And if you get stuck, don't be afraid to ask
for help.

   </li><li><strong>Start communicating with the developers.</strong>
	<br>Join the mailing list, IRC channel, or any other communication
channels the developers use. Listen, get to know the people involved, and ask
questions.

   <ul>
		<li>In almost all cases, you should <strong>communicate in
public</strong> rather than in private. GSoC is a busy time for many
developers and many beginner questions get asked repeatedly. Help keep your
devs less stressed out by reading what they've written already and making it
easier for them to have a record of the things they've answered. You can use
a pseudonym/nickname if you want. Also, search those archives to make sure
you're not asking something that's just been asked by someone else!

      </li><li>If you want to make the best first impressions, <a href="faq.html#dearsir">DO NOT start
with "Dear Sir."</a> and <a href="faq.html#ask2ask">DO NOT ask to ask</a>.

   </li></ul>

   </li><li><strong>Find some beginner-friendly bugs and try to fix them.</strong>
	<br>Many projects have these tagged as "easy" "bite-size" or
"beginner-friendly" so try searching for those terms or looking at the tags
to figure out which bugs might be good for you.

   <ul>
	 <li>Note that if you apply as a student with the PSF you will be asked to
submit a code sample, generally code related to your project. A few fixed
bugs with code accepted upstream will make your application look great!

	</li><li>Remember, competition for easy bugs is very high during GSoC so it can
be hard to find one that's tagged. If you don't see anything from your
search, read through the bugs and choose a few that sound like something you
can fix.  Remember to ask for help if you get stuck for too long, "I'm a new
contributor and was trying to work on bug#123456. I have a question about how
to..." -- if people can't help, sometimes they will be able to suggest
another bug which would be more beginner-suitable.

	</li><li>Other "easy" bug ideas: find typos and fix them.  Set up new tests --
even if the project doesn't need the first one you write, practice writing
test cases is useful for later.  Try using a tool like pylint to find issues
(but remember not everyone cares about the same things!).
</li></ul>

   </li><li><strong>Find bugs and report them.</strong>
   <br>Hopefully you won't encounter too many, but it's always a good
idea to get familiar with your project's bug reporting process.

   </li><li><strong>Help with documentation.</strong>
	<br>As a beginner in your project, you're going to see things that are
confusing that more experienced developers may not notice. Take advantage of
your beginner mindset and make sure to document anything you think is
missing!

   </li><li><strong>Help others.</strong>
	<br>This is a great idea for a lot of reasons: explaining things can
help you learn them better, demonstrating your skills as a good community
member can make you more memorable when your mentors have to choose
candidates, and being helpful makes your community a better place!
